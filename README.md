Model & Design Project:
Automated Snow Machine - Model & Design  |  Spring Semester, 2025
Collaborated with a team to construct a scaled-down version of a snow machine that was able to pivot the nozzle, allowing for a wider range and thus reducing the number of machines to cover a hill. 
Developed a 3D model (Designed in OnShape) of a miniature air compressor powered by a stepper motor, as well as a pinch valve controlled by a servo motor.
Featured as a finalist in the 2025 MTU Design Expo.
